Market Segmentation

By Technology
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) – Represents GNSS technology, which unites GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou. Of all existing positioning units for automotive maps, GNSS technology is known for its global coverage and high precision, which is crucial in vehicle navigation.
INS relies on accelerometers and gyroscopes to provide position data. It is typically combined with GNSS to enhance accuracy, more specifically when the signals from satellites are not strong.
Dead Reckoning: The dead reckoning is a technology used to estimate the current location of a vehicle based on the previous location and velocity data. It is used as a standby for GNSS in tunnels and urban canyons where signals from satellites are blocked.
By Application

Passenger Cars: The key driver of automotive map positioning devices is basically passenger cars. In this class, passenger cars have emerged as a massive section with the rapid application of navigation devices, connected car technologies, and ADAS.
Commercial Vehicles: Besides passenger vehicles, a fleet of different commercial vehicles, such as trucks, buses, and delivery vans, is also a developing market for map positioning units. A big fleet of vehicles requires positioning data with accuracy for management purposes, route optimization, and delivering on time.
By Region

North America: The excellent adoption of advanced automotive technology, coupled with considerable automotive manufacturing and technology infrastructures, positions North America as a leading market for automotive map positioning units.

Europe: Europe is another large market, quite focused on the development of connected and autonomous vehicles. It also has very stringent safety regulations, however, which make this type of map positioning equipment require very high precision. Asia-Pacific: The Asia-Pacific market is expected to be the fastest-growing market due to the increasing demand for vehicles in the region, rapid urbanization, and various government measures to promote smart transportation systems.

Rest Of The World: Regions like Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are also promising to expand as automotive markets strengthen and the use of navigation and ADAS technologies increases
